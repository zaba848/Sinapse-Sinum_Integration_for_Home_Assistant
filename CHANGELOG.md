# Changelog

All notable changes to the Sinum (Sinapse) Home Assistant integration are documented here.

---
## Upgrading

### Before You Update
1. **Backup your Home Assistant configuration**: `config/custom_components/sinum/` directory.
2. **Check for breaking changes**: Review the release notes below for your version.
3. **Test in staging first**: If you have a development HA instance, test there first.

### After You Update
1. **Reload the integration**: Go to **Settings** -> **Devices & Services** -> **Sinum** -> **Reload**.
2. **Verify entities**: Check that all entities are still available in **Settings** -> **Devices & Services** -> **Sinum**.
3. **Check automations**: If you use Sinum buttons/events in automations, verify they still trigger correctly.

### Reporting Issues
- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/zaba848/sinapse-sinum-integration-for-home-assistant/issues) for bugs.
- For security vulnerabilities, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.5] — 2026-07-02

### Removed
- **`scene.py` deleted** — dead code (0% coverage, not registered in PLATFORMS, used obsolete `hass.data[DOMAIN]` pattern). Scenes are already exposed via the `button` platform (`SinumSceneButton`).

### Tests
- **+54 tests** (1 689 → 1 743 passing) covering motion event entities (`SinumMotionEvent`), coordinator motion dispatch, `device_trigger` scene-activated paths, `__init__` service handlers (`run_scene`, `upload_mqtt_bridge`), notification error paths, WS bridge start failure/stop, stale cleanup callback, alarm night/unbypass errors, binary sensor gear-absent and status-fallback paths, camera `url3` attribute and `async_is_supported` parse exception, WebSocket reconnect-attempt reset, config flow host normalisation, WebSocket path validator, probe-retry exhaustion, and SLINK scale factor.
- **100% line coverage** on all 28 modules — first time the integration has zero missing lines.
- Smoke check extended with LoRa/SLINK/Modbus optional endpoints and LoRa device EUI/firmware report.

---

## [0.7.4] — 2026-07-01

### Changed
- **Hub name prefix only in multi-hub setups** — device names no longer carry the hub name prefix (e.g. `tablica-wtp: Energy Meter 1`) when only one Sinum hub is configured. The prefix is added automatically when two or more hubs are active so device names stay unique across HA. Applies to all entity types using `SinumDeviceAvailableMixin.device_info` and `hub_prefixed_name` (parent, camera, event, schedule, update, sensor_virtual entities).

## [0.7.3] — 2026-07-01

### Added
- **LoRa device EUI and firmware in device registry** — `sensor_bus.py` and `binary_sensor.py` now populate `serial_number` (from the LoRa EUI field) and `sw_version` (from `software_version`, e.g. `ACW THO v4.x/v5.x`) in the HA device registry for all LoRa-bus entities. Verified on live ACW THO temperature + humidity sensor on `sinum-lora` hub.

### Quality
- 1682 tests passing (↑ 4 new LoRa device-info tests over v0.7.2).
- ruff ✅ | mypy ✅ | CC ≤ 4 everywhere ✅

## [0.7.2] — 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Hub firmware version sensor** — each configured hub now exposes a diagnostic `Firmware version` sensor (translation key `hub_firmware`) showing the hub firmware string (e.g. `1.24.0-alpha.4`). Extra attributes include `device_type` and `api_version` when available. The sensor is always created; `native_value` returns `None` when the hub info endpoint does not include a `version` field.
- **Integration title "Sinapse"** — added `"title": "Sinapse"` to `strings.json` and `pl.json` so the integration appears as "Sinapse" in the HA integrations UI (Settings → Devices & Services).

### Fixed
- **Ruff CI pin** — `.github/workflows/lint.yml` now installs `ruff==0.15.17` explicitly, preventing silent CI failures caused by upstream ruff breaking changes.
- **`camera.py` noqa cleanup** — removed spurious `# noqa: ARG002` comment from `async_camera_image` parameters; `ARG002` is not in the project's ruff select set, so the hint was misleading.

### Quality
- 1678 tests passing (↑ 3 new hub firmware sensor tests over v0.7.1).
- ruff ✅ | mypy ✅ | CC ≤ 4 everywhere ✅

## [0.7.1] — 2026-06-30

### Added
- **Camera RTSP for stills** — `SinumCamera` now sets `use_stream_for_stills = True`. When RTSP credentials are available (hub returns unmasked password), HA uses the RTSP stream to generate thumbnail images instead of polling the hub's HTTP snapshot endpoint. Falls back to hub snapshot when RTSP is unavailable.
- **RTSP URL caching** — `stream_source()` caches the result of the hub credential fetch so the individual device endpoint is called at most once per camera lifetime. Failed API calls are retried on next invocation; masked passwords are cached as `None` (no pointless retries).

### Fixed
- Removed unused `_VIDEO_STATUS_OFFLINE` constant from `camera.py` (IDE hint).
- Production hub IP addresses replaced with generic placeholders (`<WTP_HUB_IP>` etc.) in `PLAN.md`, `HARDWARE_TEST_PLAN.md`, and HIL script docstrings.
- Real hub IPs replaced with `10.0.0.x` placeholders in unit tests (`test_init_setup.py`, `test_config_flow.py`, `test_retry_integration.py`).

### Quality
- 1675 tests passing (↑ 4 new camera caching tests over v0.7.0).
- ruff ✅ | mypy ✅ | CC ≤ 4 everywhere ✅

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-30

### Added
- **Camera motion events via WebSocket** — `motion_detected` WS event type is now dispatched from the WebSocket bridge to the coordinator and surfaced as a Home Assistant `EventEntity` on video camera devices. Automations can trigger on camera motion without polling.
- **SBUS blind position feedback via WebSocket** — `device_state_changed` events now update `current_opening` and `current_tilt` fields on SBUS blind controller entities in real time, eliminating the poll-interval lag for cover position.
- **Alarm ARM_HOME and ARM_NIGHT modes** — `SinumAlarmZone` now supports `ARM_HOME` and `ARM_NIGHT` in addition to the existing `ARM_AWAY`. The correct `mode` field (`home`/`night`/`away`) is included in every arm command.
- **Zone bypass / unbypass** — `async_bypass_zone` and `async_unbypass_zone` service calls let automations temporarily disable alarm zone sensors with a PIN. Bypassed zones are exposed in `extra_state_attributes`.
- **Scene device triggers** — Sinum scenes are now exposed as HA Scene entities and appear as `scene_activated` Device Triggers in the automation editor, alongside the existing `pressed` button triggers.

### Fixed
- `_motion_events` is now initialized in `SinumCoordinator.__init__` instead of lazily guarded by `hasattr`, fixing a mypy type error and making the attribute visible to static analysis.
- `_handle_special_event` now accepts `str | None` as the event type parameter, matching the actual return type of `dict.get("type")` and eliminating the mypy `[arg-type]` error.

### Quality
- 1671 tests passing (↑ 4 over v0.6.0 pre-release; ↑ 23 over v0.6.0 tag).
- 4 new unit tests for P5.2 camera motion WS event routing in `test_websocket.py`.
- ruff ✅ | mypy ✅ | CC ≤ 4 everywhere ✅

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-01

### Added
- **WebSocket exponential backoff** — Reconnection now uses exponential delays (5 → 10 → 20 → 40 → 60s max) instead of fixed 5s. Prevents connection storms during hub restart or network flaps.
- **WebSocket enabled by default** — New installations now have real-time transport enabled automatically (default: `WS_ENABLED: true`). Existing entries may require manual update if pre-0.6.0.
- **WebSocket debug logging** — Unhandled event types now logged at DEBUG level for observability. Enables passive detection of new WS event types without silent failures.
- **HACS metadata** — Added `homeassistant: 2024.1.0` field to hacs.json for HACS compliance and visibility.

### Security
- **README IP removal** — Removed all production hub IP addresses from Tested Hubs table and documentation. Production hub URLs now accessed only via environment variables or CI secrets.

### Changed
- All 5 tested hubs confirmed stable on WebSocket transport as of 2026-06-30 (smoke, API coverage, HIL, WS checks all PASS).
- Entity count updated: "over 3 800 Sinum registry entities" (cleaned up v0.5.18/19 collision registry).
- README Quick Start: Step 4 simplified to "WebSocket real-time transport is enabled by default."

### Quality
- All 1648 existing tests pass with new exponential backoff and default-true WS behavior.
- ruff ✅ | mypy ✅ | CC ≤ 4 everywhere ✅

## [0.5.21] — 2026-06-30

### Security
- Removed committed live-hub credentials from hardware test documentation and smoke runner defaults. Hardware validation now reads credentials from environment variables or CI secrets only.

### Changed
- `scripts/hardware_smoke_check.py` now supports arbitrary `LABEL=URL` hub lists via `SINUM_SMOKE_HUBS` or repeated `--hub` arguments, including per-hub token variables such as `SINUM_SBUS_TOKEN`.
- `hardware-nightly.yml` now runs the real read-only smoke runner on a LAN self-hosted runner instead of mocked/unit-only checks.
- HIL WebSocket script now redacts the access token in connection logs.
- Live write validation now uses the current `SinumClient` API names and keeps alarm writes gated by `SINUM_ALARM_TEST_PIN`.
- README, development docs and implementation plan refreshed for v0.5.21 / 1 648 passing tests.

## [0.5.20] — 2026-06-30

### Quality
- **100% test coverage** on `api.py`, `coordinator.py`, `websocket.py` — added 32 tests covering: `session` property, `ensure_push_auth` login paths, 404/500 status errors, SLINK get/patch, video snapshot edge cases, `hub_name` property, `_device_class` empty branch, `SinumDeviceAvailableMixin.device_info` hub-prefix paths, WebRTC video stream message handlers (answer, candidate, bye/error).

### Changed
- Test count: 1636 → 1648

## [0.5.19] — 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- **Hub prefix for remaining platforms** — `camera.py`, `sensor_virtual.py`, `sensor_schedule.py`, `event.py`, `binary_sensor.py`, `update.py` now use `hub_prefixed_name()` for all device names. All entity platforms now produce unique device names across multiple Sinum hubs with no `_2`/`_3` collisions.

### Changed
- Test count: 1616 (unchanged — existing camera and virtual sensor tests updated with `hub_name = ""` fixture)

## [0.5.18] — 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- **Per-phase sensor names** — `phase_voltage`, `phase_current`, `phase_active_power` translation keys replaced by unique per-phase keys (`phase_1_voltage`, `phase_2_voltage`, `phase_3_voltage`, etc.). Eliminates 30 within-device entity_id collisions for 3-phase energy meters.

### Added
- 9 new translation keys per-phase (L1/L2/L3) in PL (Napięcie L1…) and EN (Phase L1 Voltage…)

### Migration — entity registry cleanup
After deploying v0.5.18, run `scripts/migrate_entity_registry.py` on the RPi host to remove stale `_2`/`_3` collision entries from the entity registry. HA will regenerate them with clean entity_ids on next restart. **Backup is created automatically.**

## [0.5.17] — 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- **Multi-hub entity_id collisions** — `SinumDeviceAvailableMixin.device_info` now prefixes every device name with the hub name (e.g. `tablica-wtp: Energy Meter 1`), so identical device names on different hubs produce distinct entity_ids without `_2`/`_3` suffixes.
- **Within-device collision** (`sensor.energy_meter_18_2`) — `total_active_power` and `energy_consumed_total` in `_MODBUS_ENERGY_METER_SENSORS` now have `translation_key` so both sensors get a distinct entity name suffix.

### Added
- `SinumCoordinator.hub_name` property returning the hub hostname/name from `hub_info`
- Translation keys `active_power` (PL: Moc aktywna) and `energy_consumed_total` (PL: Energia skumulowana)

### Changed
- Device names in HA now include hub prefix: "tablica-wtp: Energy Meter 1". Entity_ids stay stable (stored by unique_id).

## [0.5.16] — 2026-06-30

### Added
- **Modbus: heat_pump sensors** — 7 sensors: outdoor temp, heating supply/return, buffer temp, hot gas temp, compressor frequency, running hours (all disabled by default; temperatures use 0.1°C scale)
- **Modbus: inverter sensors** — 5 sensors: PV active power, grid active power, energy produced/fed today and total
- **Modbus: battery sensors** — 4 sensors: SoC (%), charge power, energy charged/discharged total
- **Modbus: car_charger sensors** — 5 sensors: charge power, current, voltage, energy charged total/today
- **Modbus: common_dhw_main sensors** — 2 sensors: DHW temperature, DHW target temperature
- **17 new translation keys** (PL + EN + strings.json) for all new sensor names
- **17 new tests** for all new modbus device types in `test_modbus_sensor.py`

### Changed
- Test count: 1605 → 1616

## [0.5.15] — 2026-06-30

### Added
- **SLINK bus support** — new device bus type discovered on Sinum hubs. Integration now fetches `/api/v1/devices/slink` and exposes:
  - **`relay`** devices as `switch` entities (on/off via PATCH, identical control path to SBUS/WTP relays)
  - **`energy_meter`** devices as `sensor` entities: `active_power`, `current`, `energy_consumed_total`, `energy_consumed_today`, `energy_consumed_yesterday`
  - SLINK devices are fetched in parallel with all other bus collections on every coordinator refresh cycle
- **Coordinator WebRTC tests** — 15 new unit tests covering all `SinumCoordinator` WebRTC methods: `register_webrtc_session`, `dispatch_webrtc_answer`, `dispatch_webrtc_candidate`, `dispatch_webrtc_error`, `close_webrtc_session`, `forward_webrtc_candidate`, `video_device_ips` — coordinator now at 97% line coverage
- **SLINK tests** — 30 new tests covering relay switch (turn on/off, availability, error handling), energy_meter sensors (all 5 fields), `build_slink_sensor_entities`, and `_apply_optional_stores` with SLINK data

### Changed
- `SinumBusRelaySwitch.async_turn_on/off` refactored to single `_patch_state` helper (eliminates duplication, adds SLINK branch)
- `_apply_optional_stores` refactored to data-driven loop (CC ≤ 4)
- Test count: 1560 → 1605

## [0.5.14] — 2026-06-29

### Fixed / Improved
- **Camera: HLS + WebRTC both available** — refactored camera WebRTC from native entity override to a registered `SinumWebRTCProvider`. Cameras now expose both HLS and WebRTC in their `camera_capabilities`, eliminating the "N elements incompatible with selected player" message when using Chromecast or other HLS-only players. WebRTC is still preferred for low-latency in-browser viewing.
- **Lint cleanup** — fixed ruff F841/F401/F541/E702/E741 errors in `scripts/validate_api_writes.py` and `scripts/validate_v040_features.py`.
- **API test coverage** — added tests for `post_video_stream_offer` and `post_video_candidate` (payload structure, `ice_servers: []`, ICE candidate forwarding, `sdp_m_line_index=None` default).

## [0.5.13] — 2026-06-29

### Fixed / Improved
- **WebRTC streaming — trickle ICE support**: updated to HA 2026.6 native WebRTC API (`async_handle_async_webrtc_offer` + `send_message` callback). Hub uses **go2rtc** internally and sends ICE candidates via trickle ICE (separate `candidate` WS messages). The integration now forwards each candidate to the HA frontend via `WebRTCCandidate`, enabling proper peer-to-peer connection setup and smoother streaming.
- **ICE server format fix**: hub rejects external STUN servers — changed `ice_servers` in SDP offer from `[{urls: stun:...}]` to `[]`. Hub manages ICE internally.
- **Browser → hub ICE forwarding**: `async_on_webrtc_candidate` now posts browser ICE candidates back to hub via `POST /api/v1/devices/video/{id}/stream` with `type: candidate`.
- **Session tracking**: WebRTC sessions are now keyed by `session_id` (string UUID) rather than `device_id` (int), allowing multiple simultaneous sessions and proper cleanup via `close_webrtc_session`.
- **Bug fix in coordinator**: stray `self.removed_ids = {}` inside `reject_webrtc_answer` (which reset stale-device tracking on every WebRTC rejection) moved to `__init__`.

### Internal
- `coordinator.py`: replaced `_webrtc_futures` (Future-based) with `_webrtc_sessions` dict and `dispatch_webrtc_answer/candidate/error` + `close_webrtc_session`.
- `websocket.py`: added `_dispatch_video_message` + `_handle_video_candidate` for trickle ICE; updated all handlers to use `session_id`.
- `camera.py`: removed old `async_handle_web_rtc_offer → str`; added `async_handle_async_webrtc_offer`, `async_on_webrtc_candidate`, `close_webrtc_session`.
- `api.py`: `post_video_candidate()` for forwarding browser ICE candidates; `post_video_stream_offer` now sends empty `ice_servers`.

## [0.5.12] — 2026-06-29

### New Features
- **Camera WebRTC streaming**: clicking play on a Sinum camera now opens a live video stream via WebRTC. The hub exposes a `/api/v1/devices/video/{id}/stream` WebRTC signaling endpoint (POST SDP offer → hub sends SDP answer via WebSocket). HA frontend calls `async_handle_web_rtc_offer()` → integration proxies the signaling → real-time video in the HA dashboard and media browser.
- All camera entities now declare `CameraEntityFeature.STREAM` (previously only `ip_camera`/`onvif_camera`). `_attr_frontend_stream_type = StreamType.WEB_RTC`.

### Internal
- `coordinator.py`: `register_webrtc_future`, `resolve_webrtc_answer`, `reject_webrtc_answer` — per-device Future registry for async WebRTC answer delivery.
- `websocket.py`: handles `video_stream_message` WS events (`type: answer/bye/error`) and resolves/rejects pending WebRTC futures.
- `api.py`: `post_video_stream_offer()` + `API_VIDEO_STREAM` constant.

### Tests
- `TestCameraWebRtc` (4 tests): `frontend_stream_type`, offer resolved by coordinator, timeout raises `HomeAssistantError`, bye/error rejects future.
- `TestCameraFeatures`: all camera types now have `STREAM` feature (was only streamable types).

## [0.5.11] — 2026-06-29

### Bug Fixes
- **Camera entity naming**: `SinumCamera.name` now returns `None` (entity represents the whole device). Previously the camera name was used for both device name and entity name, causing HA to display it twice (e.g. "rejestrator 1 rejestrator 1"). Now shows correctly as "rejestrator 1".
- **Camera device merging**: removed MAC address from `device_info["connections"]`. Multiple camera channels on the same DVR share one MAC address; including it caused HA to merge all channels into one device with a wrong name.

### Tests
- **camera platform**: `test_name_from_device` → `test_name_is_none`, `test_name_reflects_live_rename` → `test_device_info_name_reflects_live_rename`, `test_device_gone_from_coordinator_returns_empty` updated; `test_mac_in_connections` → `test_no_connections`.

## [0.5.10] — 2026-06-29

### New Features
- **`sinum.run_scene` service**: trigger a Sinum hub Lua scene by numeric ID from HA automations and scripts. Complements the existing scene button entities. Registered with the same `entry_id` routing pattern as other multi-hub services. EN + PL translations added.

### Bug Fixes
- **`sinum.run_scene` unload**: service is now correctly removed when the last Sinum config entry is unloaded (was missing from the cleanup loop).

### Improvements
- **Diagnostics**: video devices (cameras) are now included in HA diagnostic reports. Camera credentials (`login`, `password`) are redacted to `**REDACTED**`. `video_count` added to bus counts.
- **Docs**: camera section updated in `entities.md` and `entities.pl.md` — live RTSP streaming is supported (previously incorrectly stated as unavailable).

### Tests
- **notify platform**: 18 new tests — `async_send_message`, default title, `SinumNotSupportedError` → `HomeAssistantError`, setup, hub info edge cases.
- **camera live updates**: 4 tests verifying that `SinumCamera` properties reflect coordinator changes pushed via WebSocket without HA lifecycle overhead.
- **diagnostics**: video device redaction tests + fixture alignment.
- **`sinum.run_scene`**: 2 integration tests (single hub, explicit `entry_id`).
- **Total: 1 546 tests** across 46 files

## [0.5.9] — 2026-06-29

### New Features
- **Camera support**: IP cameras and ONVIF cameras configured in the Sinum hub are now exposed as HA `camera` entities.
  - Snapshots fetched via hub proxy endpoint (`/api/v1/devices/video/{id}/snapshot`).
  - Live streaming (`CameraEntityFeature.STREAM`) enabled for `ip_camera` and `onvif_camera` types — HA proxies RTSP via its internal stream engine; the URL is never sent to the browser.
  - `stream_source()` calls the individual device endpoint to obtain unmasked credentials (the list endpoint masks passwords as `*******`); returns `None` when hub still masks credentials, HA falls back to snapshot-only mode.
  - Camera attributes exposed: `video_type`, `ip`, `port`, `url_path`, `mac`, `status`, `purpose`, `room_id` (passwords and login credentials never exposed in entity state).
  - Brand populated from hub `variant` field (e.g. `hikvision`); `generic` variants return `None`.
  - Availability follows coordinator `last_update_success` (standard `CoordinatorEntity` pattern).
- **Total: 1 516 tests** across 45 files

## [0.5.8] — 2026-06-29

### Bug Fixes
- **WTP temperature regulator sensor: 0.0°C → unavailable**: regulators without a physical sensor previously showed `0.0°C`; now correctly report "Unavailable" when the hub sends `temperature: 0`. Achieved by setting `zero_is_unavailable=True` on the `wtp_regulator` temperature sensor description.

### Code Quality
- **mypy clean**: fixed `light._is_button_with_color` signature — `dev_type: str` widened to `str | None` (was flagged by mypy as incompatible with `device.get("type")` return type).
- **Total: 1 499 tests** across 44 files

## [0.5.7] — 2026-06-26

### Documentation
- **PL docs complete**: added `docs/installation.pl.md`, `docs/entities.pl.md`, `docs/real-time.pl.md`, `docs/development.pl.md` — full Polish translations of all 4 docs files; README.pl.md now links to `.pl.md` versions
- **EN↔PL language switchers**: all 4 EN docs now include `· Polski` links; all PL docs link back to EN
- **Official Sinum resources section**: added to both READMEs with links to `apidocs.sinum.tech`, Lua scripting manual PDF, Sinum FAQ, knowledge base, and Google Home integration guide
- **Translations `upload_mqtt_bridge`**: service added to both `translations/en.json` and `translations/pl.json` (was missing)

### Code Quality
- **Ruff lint clean**: 32 ruff errors fixed (22 auto-fixed + 10 manual): import sorting, unused imports, `SIM117`/`SIM105`/`SIM102` simplifications, F821 forward refs removed, HIL `C901` suppressed

## [0.5.6] — 2026-06-26

### Quality — Code & Tests
- **websocket.py 100% coverage**: +10 tests covering `_run`, `_wait_reconnect`, `_consume_loop`, `_receive_messages`, and edge cases (`_handle_event` non-dict data, `_apply_device_state` non-dict payload)
- **`ConfigEntryAuthFailed` on auth errors**: `_safe_fetch` now re-raises `SinumAuthError` (was silently swallowed); `_async_update_data` wraps the fetch in a try/except and converts it to `ConfigEntryAuthFailed` — HA automatically shows a "Re-authenticate" persistent notification
- **Device registry cleanup**: `_cleanup_stale_entities` now also removes device cards from the device registry (not just entity registry entries) when a hub device disappears
- **Total: 1 498 tests** across 44 files

### Bug Fixes
- **README.pl.md**: fixed 4 broken links pointing to non-existent `docs/*.pl.md` files (now point to EN docs)

## [0.5.5] — 2026-06-26

### Quality — Code & Tests
- **CC zero-legacy**: all 19 previously exempted functions refactored to CC ≤ 4. `_LEGACY_ALLOWANCE = {}` — no exemptions remain.
  - `alarm_control_panel`: extracted `_format_alarm_inputs` helper
  - `binary_sensor`: extracted `_fan_coil_gear_active` helper
  - `camera`: extracted `_camera_base_attrs` + `_CAMERA_BASE_KEYS` constant
  - `cover`: extracted `_apply_restored_position`, `_apply_restored_tilt`, `_compare_target_current`, `_sbus_blind_features`, `_sbus_blind_device_info`
  - `light`: 13 new module-level helpers/constants (rgb detection, color mode, restore state, Lua command builders)
- **WebSocket edge tests** (+19 tests): PING dispatch, `source` field fallback, auth-fail `PermissionError`, reconnect exception handling, stop-event exit
- **Stale device cleanup**: coordinator tracks `removed_ids` per bus after each refresh; `__init__.py` registers a listener that removes entity registry entries for disappeared device IDs. Protects against accidental removal on API failures.
- **Stale cleanup tests** (+10 tests): `_stale_uid_prefixes`, `_is_stale_entity`, `_cleanup_stale_entities` coverage
- **Total: 1 481 tests** across 44 files (~8 s runtime)

### Documentation — Full Overhaul
- **README.md**: rewritten as a compact, scannable landing page with architecture diagram, entity table, tested hubs matrix, all docs linked
- **README.pl.md**: full Polish translation matching EN structure (previously incomplete)
- **docs/installation.md**: step-by-step guide with all setup screenshots, troubleshooting table, rollback instructions
- **docs/entities.md**: complete entity reference — all platforms, attributes, availability semantics, automation examples
- **docs/real-time.md**: WebSocket + MQTT transport guide with architecture diagrams and troubleshooting tables
- **docs/development.md**: developer guide — project structure, CC rules, adding new sensors/platforms/virtual types, test patterns, live hub debugging

## [0.3.9] — 2026-06-25

### Hardening — Onboarding & Connection Resilience
- **Host validation**: Config flow now rejects invalid host formats (e.g., URLs with path, query, or fragment).
- **Retry logic**: Connection probes during onboarding automatically retry on transient errors.
- **Fallback mode**: If hub info retrieval is temporarily unavailable after successful login, onboarding proceeds with a graceful fallback using hub name from host.
- **User-facing error messages**: New `invalid_host` error translation in EN/PL.
- **Test coverage**: Comprehensive test suite for failsafe/fallback paths and retry logic.

### Quality
- Live hardware validation: Both hubs (WTP, SBUS) verified ✅ — all key API endpoints responsive (200).
- 100% line coverage maintained across config_flow, API client, and retry helpers.
- All CI/Lint/CodeQL/HACS workflows passing.

## [0.3.8] — 2026-06-24

### Test Coverage

- Final missing branches were covered in setup/filtering and helper edge-case paths.

### Quality
- Full local validation passed: `1234 passed`.
- Release gate checks on main passed (`CI`, `Lint`, `CodeQL Security Analysis`, `HACS Validation`).

## [0.3.7] — 2026-06-24

### Quality
- Fixed Mypy compatibility issues in `climate.py`, `light.py`, and `switch.py` that were failing the CI `Lint` workflow.
- Re-validated locally with: `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `mypy custom_components/sinum --ignore-missing-imports --no-site-packages`, and full test suite (`1220 passed`).

## [0.3.6] — 2026-06-24

### Quality
- Fixed CI `Lint` workflow failures by applying repository-wide `ruff format` changes.
- Verified locally after formatting: `ruff format --check`, `ruff check`, and full test suite (`1220 passed`).

- Both hubs passed login and core API endpoint checks (`/api/v1/info`, `/api/v1/devices/wtp`, `/api/v1/devices/sbus`, `/api/v1/devices/virtual`).

### Quality
- Full test suite passed (`1220 passed`).
- API-focused test suite passed (`117 passed`).
- Global coverage remains at 99% total for `custom_components/sinum`.

## [0.3.4] — 2026-06-24

### Test Coverage

## [0.3.2] — 2026-06-24

### Added
- Complexity quality gate enabled in Ruff (`C901`, mccabe max-complexity = 8) to prevent high-complexity regressions.

### Changed
- Release Gate behavior on push: pending required workflows are now treated as non-blocking to avoid false failures immediately after push.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-24

### Fixed
- Cover regression fix: `SinumBlindCover` now preserves last known position/tilt when coordinator snapshot is temporarily missing.
- SBUS RGB regression fix: optimistic state after HS color command now stores `led_color` and correctly reflects switch to RGB mode.
- Post-release validation: hardware smoke check refreshed in `docs/hardware_smoke_latest.md`.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-24

### Added
- Release stabilization policy and rollback procedure documented in `README.md` (Etap 0).
- Hardware smoke automation script (`scripts/hardware_smoke_check.py`) for WTP/SBUS API reachability and endpoint checks.
- Release gate status checker (`scripts/check_release_gate.py`) to validate required workflow outcomes before release activities.
- CI quality dashboard generator (`scripts/ci_quality_dashboard.py`) and scheduled workflow (`quality-dashboard.yml`) for pass-rate and duration tracking.
- Regression tests for critical areas:
  - API auth refresh edge case (refresh token retention)
  - Cover fallback behavior when device snapshot disappears
  - Firmware response normalization contracts (wrapper variants)

### Changed
- Neutral community branding mode (Etap 2A):
  - removed vendor-specific icon mapping from `manifest.json`
  - replaced brand assets with neutral community icon set
- Project version bumped to `0.3.0`.

## [0.2.9] — 2026-06-24

### Added
- Legal hardening in project documentation:
  - explicit non-affiliation notice in `README.md`
  - trademark and compliance clauses in `LICENSE`
  - legal/conduct rules for contributors in `CONTRIBUTING.md`

### Changed
- Clarified project status as unofficial community integration across user-facing docs.

- `README.md`: added stability badge linking to test-stability workflow.

## [0.2.7] — 2026-06-24

### Changed
- CI quality gates strengthened: single-pass coverage report generation with `coverage.xml` and pip cache in `ci.yml`.
- `tests.yml` now runs **Functional Smoke Tests** (critical behavior paths) instead of duplicating the full suite.
- Hardware validation process formalized in `HARDWARE_TEST_PLAN.md` with a release checklist and explicit CC + smoke + manual hardware gate.
- `validate.yml` no longer skips HACS validation on push/PR due to repository visibility checks.
- Added a documented hardware smoke test result (2026-06-24) for WTP and SBUS hubs.
- `SECURITY.md` replaced template content with an actionable vulnerability handling policy for current release lines.
- `codeql.yml` now always executes CodeQL in public-repo mode (no soft skip fallback).

### Added
- New `dependency-review.yml` workflow for pull requests to detect risky dependency changes.
- Translation consistency tests (`test_translations_consistency.py`) to keep config/options/entity UI labels synchronized across `strings.json`, `en.json`, and `pl.json`.
- Additional functional tests for WTP-specific sensor types (`co2_sensor`, `pressure_sensor`, `iaq_sensor`, `aq_sensor`) and WTP `fan_coil_v2` climate setup path.

## [0.2.6] — 2026-06-24

### Changed
- **Repository rebranding**: canonical repository path updated to
  `zaba848/sinapse-sinum-integration-for-home-assistant`.
- **Project metadata**: integration manifest and Python project metadata version bumped to `0.2.6`.
- **Documentation links**: README installation and clone instructions now point to the new repository URL.
- **Contributor docs**: issue tracker links in `CONTRIBUTING.md` updated to the renamed repository.

## [0.2.5] — 2026-06-24

### Changed
- **`sensor_bus.py` split**: sensor descriptions (pure data) extracted to
  `sensor_bus_descriptions.py`; `sensor_bus.py` now contains only entity classes.
  Backward-compatible re-export keeps all existing imports unchanged.
- **`cover.py` RestoreEntity guard**: position/tilt properties now use `if self._device:`
  pattern (same as `light.py`) — when hub is online, live coordinator data is always
  authoritative and never falls back to stale restored values.
- **`SinumDeviceAvailableMixin`**: added `_device` property stub so mypy
  understands the contract; removed now-redundant `# type: ignore` comments.
- **`diagnostics.py`**: LoRa devices (`lora_devices`, `lora_count`) included in output.
- **Translations**: `reconfigure` step and `reconfigure_successful` abort synced to
  `en.json` and `pl.json` (were only in `strings.json`).

### Added
- **Device trigger tests** (`tests/test_device_trigger.py`): 16 tests covering all
  `async_get_triggers`, `async_attach_trigger`, and `async_validate_trigger_config` paths.
- **`mypy` clean**: all 24 source files pass `mypy --ignore-missing-imports` with 0 errors.

---

## [0.2.4] — 2026-06-24

### Added
- **`SinumDeviceAvailableMixin`** — all 28 entity classes now report `unavailable` immediately when
  the hub is offline or the device is missing from the coordinator snapshot.
- **`async_step_reconfigure`** in config flow — change hub IP or credentials without removing
  the integration; all entities and automations are preserved.
- **`async_migrate_entry`** — automatic data migration for older config entries (backfills
  `auth_mode` key missing from pre-0.2 entries).
- **`RestoreEntity`** for all cover and light classes — last-known position, tilt, brightness,
  and color survive a Home Assistant restart without waiting for the next hub poll.
- **`device_trigger.py`** — Sinum buttons appear as native device triggers in the HA automation
  editor ("A button was pressed").
- **`quality_scale: silver`** in `manifest.json`.
- GitHub issue templates (bug report, feature request), Dependabot weekly updates, CodeQL workflow.
- Config flow tests for reconfigure flow and `async_migrate_entry` (1020 tests total).
- LoRa devices included in `diagnostics.py` output (`lora_devices`, `lora_count`).
- `reconfigure` step translations in `en.json` and `pl.json`.

### Fixed
- `translations/en.json` and `pl.json` were missing `reconfigure` step and
  `reconfigure_successful` abort reason — now in sync with `strings.json`.

---

## [0.2.3] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- **SBUS button polling**: SBUS hub resets `action` field to `""` immediately after press —
  by the time the coordinator polls, the action type is gone. Press is now always detected via
  `buttons_count` increment. Event fires with `action=None` when action has already been reset;
  for real-time action type use the MQTT bridge.
- **hacs.json**: removed `"homeassistant"` key that caused HACS validation failure

### Added
- Brand assets (`custom_components/sinum/brand/icon.png`, `icon@2x.png`) for HACS v2 listing
- HACS GitHub Actions validation workflow (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`)

---

## [0.2.2] — 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- **Button event: consecutive same-type presses no longer missed** — `SinumButtonEvent` now also
  tracks `buttons_count` (hub-side cumulative counter). If `action` stays at e.g. `"single"` but
  the count increments, the event fires again. Previously a second single-press would be silently
  dropped if the hub didn't reset the `action` field between presses.

### Changed
- **Event entity payload** now includes `buttons_count` alongside `action`
- **README**: new "Event — Physical Buttons" section with action values, automation YAML examples,
  step-by-step MQTT setup guide for instant button response (< 1 s), comparison table

### Added
- 3 new tests for `buttons_count`-based event detection (990 total)

---

## [0.2.1] — 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- **API: robust JSON parsing** — new `_read_json()` helper replaces direct `resp.json()` calls;
  handles empty response body, non-JSON / HTML error pages, and body-read failures
  (`ClientPayloadError`) by raising `SinumConnectionError` with a clear message instead of crashing
- **Token refresh**: `_refresh_jwt()` returns `False` instead of raising when the refresh
  endpoint returns non-JSON, preventing an unhandled exception in the auth retry path
- **`content_length` guard** was unreliable when hub omits the `Content-Length` header;
  replaced with raw-byte read + empty check
- **`light.py` ruff E402**: `_LOGGER` moved after all imports

### Changed
- **Button backlights** (`button` RGB backlight channel) moved to `EntityCategory.CONFIG` —
  visible only in the device configuration page, not on the main dashboard
- **Temperature sensors returning 0.0 °C**: virtual thermostats and SBUS sensors without a
  physical probe now report `unknown` instead of `0.0` via `zero_is_unavailable` flag
- **RGB Controller — SBUS**: full color control via persistent Lua scenes (`_ha_rgb_sbus_{id}`);
  REST PATCH replaced for color and brightness to avoid hub read-only field errors
- **Tests expanded**: 880 → 987 tests; 5 new `TestReadJsonErrorHandling` tests added
- **README** rewritten with architecture diagram, entity reference, dev guide,
  Lua integration examples, and "Adding New Device Types" walkthrough

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Event entity** for button devices (`button_press`) — real-time automations without polling state
- New SBUS and virtual device types: `button`, `valve_pump`, `common_valve`, `analog_output`, `pulse_width_modulation`, `heat_pump_manager`
- Thermal schedule sensors: target/fallback temperature, active period, association count
- `SinumHeatPumpManagerClimate` — heat pump manager climate entity with heating/cooling/auto modes
- Hub connectivity binary sensors and firmware update entities for parent devices
- Coordinator bulk-fetch fallback: preserves cached device data during hub outages
- MQTT bridge v0.8.0: full device coverage for all supported types

### Changed
- Button `last_action` sensor is now disabled by default (use the new event entity for automations)
- MQTT bridge `OPTIONAL_FIELDS` expanded to cover all new device types
- Improved defensive coding in cover, switch, light, sensor entities

### Fixed
- Coordinator flood-log: 400+ WARNINGs on hub outage reduced to single DEBUG message
- Unused imports removed from `climate.py`, `light.py`, `cover.py`

---
